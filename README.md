Part 1.1
========

Set of paths covered by KLEE with symbolic variable 'a': `/part1/p1a.c`

Set of paths covered by KLEE with symbolic variable 'b': `/part1/p1b.c`

Set of paths covered by KLEE with symbolic variable 'c': `/part1/p1c.c`

Set of paths covered by KLEE with all symbolic variables _including_ infeasible path: `/part1/p1.c`

Part 1.2
========

Directory containing abort.err.file, .ktest file and content of symbolic file in the test case that causes a bug: `/part1/gnupg-buggy/test_case_with_bug`

Script to initialize coverage, run g10/gpg and generate coverage report: `part1/gnupg-buggy/run-test-case-script.rb`

Directory containing overall coverage report in HTML: `part1/gnupg-buggy/html`

Directory containing all the test cases generated by KLEE: `part/gnupg-buggy/klee-out-0`

Part 2.1
========

Modified code using singly linked list to track my_malloc and my_free: `/part2/malloc.c` and `/part2/malloc.h`

Running KLEE using one symbolic file of size 6 bytes and marking `option` and `newKey` as symbolic variables, we can find a test case that causes a memory leak. Running KLEE using symbolic file of size 7 bytes yield same reults. Directory containing abort.err.file and .ktest file: `/part2/test_case_with_memory_leak`. 

Part 2.2
========

One of KLEE's limitations is that KLEE cannot handle symbolic floating points. As a result, I have modified `p1.c` from part1, using float in place of int. Running KLEE generates only 1 test case. KLEE did not manage to cover all feasible paths. Directory containing modified `p1.c`: `/part2/cannot_cover_all_feasible_paths`
