This program uses the zlib compression library written by
Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

Most of the stuff in mpi has been taken from the GMP library by
Torbjorn Granlund <tege@noisy.tmg.se>.

The Rijndael implementation (cipher/rijndael.c) is based on the 
public domain reference code provided for the AES selection process.
The Rijndael algorithm is due to Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. 

The files cipher/rndunix.c and cipher/rndw32.c are based on rndunix.c
and rndwin32.c from cryptlib.
