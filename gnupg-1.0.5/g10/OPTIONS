compress-keys
# compress exported key, compress level is still set with "-z" and
# algorithm with --compress-algo" - Default is to not compress keys, as
# this is better for interoperability.

compress-sigs
# Normally, compressing of signatures does not make sense; so this
# is disabled for detached signatures unless this option is used.

run-as-shm-coprocess [request-locked-shm-size]
# very special :-)
# You will have to use "--status-fd" too
# Note:  This option does only work if given on the command line.
